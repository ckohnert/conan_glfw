# Conan file for the GLFW library.

Was only able to test this on linux: Linux Mint 18.

On linux, this will download the source and compile it

On Windows, it will *hopefully* download the binaries provided by the dev team.

No implementation for MacoOS. I do not have a Mac so I have no idea how to compile stuff on it.
